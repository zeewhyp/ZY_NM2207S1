Hello! I am Zong Yao, currently a Year 2 Communications and New Media student in NUS. I have always been interested in learning new things, and was quite excited to take the [NM2207](https://nusmods.com/courses/NM2207/computational-media-literacy) module. In today's age, everything is becoming increasingly online, so picking up knowledge in this domain is always useful in my opinion. 

Despite the relatively steep learning curve, I have enjoyed my time so far learning the R language for this module, and it is a welcome breath of fresh air from the usual essays and weekly readings. Going forward, I will continue to improve on my coding skills. After learning R, I hope to move on to Python and maybe even Javascript. I believe it will be useful for my future pursuits, and will complement my skill sets and my CNM knowledge. 

Thanks for taking the time to explore my website. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
