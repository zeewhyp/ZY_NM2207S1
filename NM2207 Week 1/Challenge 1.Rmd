## R Markdown

Hello, this is Phua Zong Yao. I am a year 2 CNM student. I enjoy playing football, basketball and floorball. I am also playing IFG floorball for FASS. 

```{r, out.height= "350px",out.width= "500px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="KDA League of Legends"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/pzy00/Pictures/Wallpapers/lol kda wallpaper og.jpg") 
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
