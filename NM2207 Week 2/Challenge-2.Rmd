  <strong>Welcome!</strong> Hope you have watched the lecture videos and followed the instructions in code-along. Go through the steps described below, _carefully_. It is totally fine to get stuck - <strong>ASK FOR HELP</strong>; reach out to your friends, TAs, or the discussion forum on Canvas.
  
&nbsp;

Here is what you have to do,
<br>
<br>

1. <strong>Pair</strong> with a neighbor and work 

2. <strong>Download</strong> the `Challenge-2.Rmd` and `playlist_data.csv` files from Canvas

# I. Exploring music preferences

### A. Background

Imagine that you have been hired as a data analyst by a radio station to analyze music preferences of their DJs. They have provided you with a dataset, `playlist_data.csv`, containing information about DJs, their preferred music genres, song titles, and ratings. 

Using the data-set you are required to complete some tasks that are listed subsequently. All these tasks are based on the concepts taught in the video lectures. The questions may not be entirely covered in the lectures; To complete them, you are encouraged to use Google and the resources therein.
<br>

### B.Tasks

#### Task-1

In the lecture, we used two data-sets, `starwars` and `anscombe's quartet` that were readily available with the packages, `tidyverse` and `Tmisc`, respectively. When we have to use custom-made data-sets or the ones like we downloaded from Canvas, we have to import it using the R commands before using them. All the questions below are related to this task.
<br>
<br>

**Question 1.1:** What does the term "CSV" in `playlist_data.csv` stand for, and why is it a popular format for storing tabular data?

**Solution:** _csv stands for 'comma separated value'. csv is a simple and universal format which can be easily read and written by many programs and tools, such as python, R, SQL and text editors. _ 
<br>
<br>
**Question 1.2:** load the `tidyverse` package to work with `.csv` files in R.  

**Solution:** 


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Load the necessary package to work with CSV files in R.
library(tidyverse)
```
<br>

**Question 1.3:** Import the data-set, `playlist_data.csv`

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Import the "playlist_data.csv" dataset into R 

read.csv("playlist_data.csv") 

```
<br>

**Question 1.4:** Assign the data-set to a variable, `playlist_data`

**Solution:** 


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Assign the variable to a dataset 

playlist_data <- read.csv("playlist_data.csv") 

```

_From now on, you can use the name of the variable to view the contents of the data-set_
<br>
<br>

**Question 1.5:** Get more information about `read_csv()` command and provide a screenshot of the information displayed in the "Help" tab of the "Files" pane

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# More information about the R command, complete the code

?read_csv()

knitr::include_graphics("screenshot.PNG")

```

<br>

**Question 1.6:** What does the `skip` argument in the read_csv() function do?

**Solution:** _It is used to skip a specified number of rows at the beginning of the CSV file when reading it into a DataFrame. This parameter can be used to skip header rows, comments, or other unnecessary lines at the beginning of a file._ 
<br>
<br>

**Question 1.7:** Display the contents of the data-set

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Type the name of the variable, to see what it contains

playlist_data

```
<br>

**Question 1.8:** Assume you have a CSV file named `sales_data.csv` containing information about sales transactions. How would you use the `read_csv()` function to import this file into R and store it in a variable named `sales_data`?

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# No output is required for this code
# Only the list of commands that execute the task mentioned in the question are required

sales_data <- read_csv("sales_data.csv") 

```
<br>
<br>

#### Task-2

After learning to import a data-set, let us explore the contents of the data-set through the following questions
<br>
<br>

**Question 2.1:** Display the first few rows of the data-set to get an overview of its structure

**Solution:** 

  DJ_Name Music_Genre Rating Experience     Age Location Plays_Per_Week
  <chr>   <chr>        <dbl> <chr>        <dbl> <chr>             <dbl>
1 DJ A    Pop            4.2 Advanced        28 City X               80
2 DJ B    Rock           3.8 Intermediate    24 City Y               60
3 DJ C    Electronic     4.5 Advanced        30 City Z              100
4 DJ D    Pop            4   Intermediate    22 City X               70
5 DJ E    Electronic     4.8 Advanced        27 City Y               90
6 DJ F    Rock           3.6 Intermediate    25 City Z               55

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Type the name of the variable we assigned the data-set to

head(playlist_data)

```
<br>

**Question 2.2:** Display all the columns of the variable stacked one below another

**Solution:** 

   

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Stack columns of playlist_data

glimpse(playlist_data)

```
<br>

**Question 2.3:** How many columns are there in the dataset?

**Solution:**  


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Number of columns

ncol(playlist_data)

```
<br>

**Question 2.4:** What is the total count of DJs?

**Solution:** 


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Number of DJs

nrow(playlist_data)

```
<br>

**Question 2.5:** Display all the location of all the DJs

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# Location of DJs

playlist_data$Location

```
<br>

**Question 2.6:** Display the age of the DJs

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

playlist_data$Age

# Age of DJs
```
<br>
<br>

#### Task-3

Let us plot the data to get more insights about the DJs.
<br>
<br>

**Question 3.1:** Create a plot to visualize the relationship between DJs' ages and their ratings.

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# complete the code to generate the plot

ggplot(playlist_data) +
aes(x=Age,y=Rating)

```
<br>

**Question 3.2:** Label the x-axis as "Age" and the y-axis as "Rating."

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# complete the code to generate the plot

ggplot(playlist_data) +
aes(x=Age,y=Rating) +
labs(x='Age',y='Rating')


```
<br>

**Question 3.3:** Represent data using points

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# complete the code to generate the plot

ggplot(playlist_data) +
aes(x=Age,y=Rating) +
labs(x='Age',y='Rating')+
geom_point()

```
<br>

**Question 3.4:** Can you change the points represented by dots/small circles to any other shape of your liking?

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# complete the code to generate the plot

?geom_point()

ggplot(playlist_data) +
aes(x=Age,y=Rating) +
labs(x='Age',y='Rating')+
geom_point(shape=20)


```
<br>

**Question 3.5:** Insert a suitable title and briefly provide your insights in the caption

**Solution:** 

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
# complete the code to generate the plot

ggplot(playlist_data) +
aes(x=Age,y=Rating) +
labs(x='Age',y='Rating',title ="Age vs Rating",caption = 'The distribution of the age and rating is quite evenly spread out') +
geom_point(shape=20)


```
