## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Output preview:** Here is how the countdown could look like 

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/countdown.png")
```

```{r, out.height= "20px",out.width= "200px",echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/blastoff.png")
```

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here

countdown <- 10 

cat("Rocket launch countdown:\n")

while(countdown>0){
  cat(countdown,"..")
  countdown <- countdown - 1
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
cat("\nThe rocket has launched!")


```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}

# Enter code here# Function to reverse a string

entry <- "hello"

string_split <- c()
for (x in 1:nchar(entry)) {
  string_split <- c(string_split,substr(entry,x,x))
}

paste0(rev(string_split),collapse ="")

```
